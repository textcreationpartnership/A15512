            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2914:29"/>church of <hi>England;</hi> ergo, <hi>England,</hi> and all other particular churches of extent, muſt be gouerned by Biſhops. Truely I cannot but wonder, that a learned man ſhould vſe ſuch a forme of argument, which he cannot but know doth fayle in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inſtances. For example, ſome meate is abſolutely neceſſary for the mainetena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of man, but there is no more reaſon, why egs, or fiſh ſhould be neceſſary to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of man rather, then other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular meates: ergo, eggs, fiſh, and all other particular meates are neceſſary for the mainetenance of man. Or, to bring an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample neerer the purpoſe. It is of the law of God, and nature, that ſome men do marry for the preſeruing of mankinde; but (if we preciſely reſpect the law of nature) there is noe more reaſon, why one perſon, village, or citty ſhould be obliged, rather then another: ergo, euery particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, village, and citty is obliged to marry. To theſe inſtances <hi>M. Doct.</hi> muſt anſwere by diſtinguiſhing the minor propoſition. If we compare one particular meate, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paricular determinate meate, then the minor is true, that there is no more reaſon of one, then another, and ſo neither one,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2914:29"/>nor other determinately is neceſſary: But if we compare one particular meate, with other particular meates, taken in generall or indeterminately, then there is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why one particular meate is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as others taken indeterminatly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that indeterminate ſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify all particular meats in generall, which no doubt are more neceſſary for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of man, then any one determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate meate. Or to ſay all in one word, ſome meate is neceſſary, but not this or that in particular. And ſo we may eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere <hi>M. Doctours</hi> argument by the like deſtruction, that <hi>iure diuino,</hi> Biſhops are neceſſary in ſome parts of the church inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately, but not determinately in this, or that part of the church, And this were ſufficient to anſwere that ſophiſme. Yet, that the reader may ſee how weake an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it is, his <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition might be eaſily denyed, although we ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare one particular church with another particular church determinately taken: for there may reaſons occurre of perſecution, or the like, to make the caſe of one church different from that of another. And as for England in particular (beſide the knowne

            <p n="16">16 Neither need I againe put <hi>M. Doctour</hi> in mynd, that if he prooue any thing, his argument prooues that England, and Scotland alſo muſt <hi>iure diuino</hi> haue an Ordinarie, becauſe by the deuine law beſide the Supreme Paſtour, there muſt be

But now let vs ſee, what <hi>M. Doctour</hi> in his 14. chapter, where he handleth this point, doth bring in proofe of his doctrine.</p>
            <p n="14">14 His firſt argument is, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confirmation we cannot be perfect Chriſtians, ſeeing according to <hi>S. Thomas</hi> by confirmation we receiue our <hi>perfect growth.</hi> To this I haue already anſwered, &amp; now onely wiſh the reader to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that according to <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation (and conſequently the effect thereof, for example, <hi>perfect growth,</hi> and whatſoeuer elſe) may be had without a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and ſo if <hi>M. Doctour</hi> will ſticke to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2914:45"/>
               <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> his opinion muſt go downe. 15 Then he alleadgeth <hi>S. Clement</hi> Epiſt. 4. ſaying thus: <hi>Omnibus ergo feſtinandum eſt ſine morarenaſci Deo, &amp; demum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignari ab Epiſcopo; id eſt, ſeptiformem gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Spiritus Sancti percipere, quia incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt vniuſcuiuſque exitus vitae.

All therefore muſt make haſte without delay to be regenerated to God, and then to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Biſhop, that is to receiue the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenfold grace of the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe the end of euery ones life is vncertaine. But when he ſhalbe regenerated by water, and afterwards confirmed by the Biſhop, with the ſeuenfold grace of the Spirit, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he cannot be a perfect Chriſtian &amp;c.</hi> To this authority I anſwere.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Firſt <hi>M. Doctour</hi> ſhould not haue grounded ſo hard a doctrine, vpon an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, which I ſuppoſe he knoweth, not to be ſo authenticall, as to ſettle thereon a doctrinall point, as he may ſee by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in his booke <hi>de Scriptoribus Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticis.</hi> Secondly, I may anſwere, out of

                  </gap> on what ſenſe the words of Clement</hi> (cyted by M. Doctour) <hi>are to be vnderſtood.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Eſtius;</hi> whom <hi>M.

Doctours</hi> argument, but alſo ſaith that it is <hi>cleare in what ſenſe the words of S. Clement are to be vnderſtood.</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:2914:46"/>It ſeemes a hard caſe, when <hi>M. Doctour</hi> is forced to alleadge <hi>Eſtius</hi> as his chiefe Authour for the neceſſity of Confirmation (as afterwards we ſhall ſee) who in the very ſame place, deſtroyeth a maine gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, brought by <hi>M. Doctour</hi> for the neceſſity of the ſame Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there occurreth an anſwere clearely deduced out of <hi>S. Clements</hi> owne words, and, I doubt not, but will fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfye the learned reader. The common practiſe of the antient Church was (and is yet in the Eaſterne Church, and at Rome when conuerted lewes, or Turkes ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely baptized) together with Baptiſme to giue the Sacrament of Confirmation, and ſo, whoſoeuer in thoſe times was not confirmed, wanted alſo Baptiſme, &amp; hence <hi>S. Clement</hi> might well ſay that he that was not baptized, and confirmed, was not a <hi>perfect</hi> Chriſtian. But this is farre from proouing that without confirmation, as ſeparated from Baptiſme, we cannot be <hi>perfectly</hi> Chriſtians. This ſenſe is manifeſt, if we ponder <hi>S. Clements</hi> words: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſayd: <hi>All muſt make haſte to be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated to God, and then to be conſigned by the Biſhop,</hi> he ſayth not afterwards: But
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2914:47"/>when he ſhalbe confirmed by the Biſhop, becauſe otherwiſe he cannot be a perfect chriſtian, but ſtill ioyneth it with baptiſme, and ſayth: <hi>But when he ſhalbe regenerated by water, and afterwards confirmed by the Biſhop, becauſe otherwiſe he cannot be a perfect Chriſtian</hi> ſtil, as I ſaid, repeating together both thoſe ſacraments, becauſe they were wont to be adminiſtred at one time, and whoſoeuer had, or wanted one infallibly, had or wanted both of them, &amp; in that manner it was all one to ſay, one was not confirmed, as to ſay, he was not baptized. Beſides <hi>S. Clements</hi> diſcourſe (<hi>All muſt make haſt to be regenerated to God, and then to be conſigned by the Biſhop, becauſe the end of euery ones life as vncertaine,</hi> makes it cleare that his ſpeach is of Baptiſme. For howeſoeuer <hi>neceſſary</hi> Confirmation be, yet certainely it is not of ſo great <hi>haſt</hi> as <hi>S. Clement</hi> vrgeth: yea it is che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fly for thoſe who are to liue, &amp; haue occaſion to profeſſe there faith, as <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> alledgeth out of Pope <hi>Melchiades,</hi>

                  </gap>. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> &amp; therefore it had bene an vnfit reaſon of <hi>S. Clement,</hi> to haſten men to confirmation, <hi>becauſe the end of euery ones life is vncertaine,</hi> for, as I ſaid, the leſſe certainety we haue of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2914:47"/>life, and more vicinity to death, the leſſe neceſſity we haue of Confirmation: but for Baptiſme his reaſon of the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mans laſt end, is very fit, and vrgent: &amp; therefore it is cleare, <hi>S.

            <p>My fourth anſwere is, that <hi>S. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is not faithfully alledged by <hi>M. Doctour.</hi> For <hi>S. Clement,</hi> after he had ſaid: <hi>When he ſhalbe regenerated by water, and afterward, Confirmed by the Biſhop with the ſeuenfold grace of the Spirits, becauſe otherwiſe he cannot be a perfect Chriſtian</hi> (where <hi>M.

And in this particular, there appeares a maine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, betwixt a Religious man, and a Biſhop, who is not at all bound to pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to chaſtity, he is obliged only as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſts, by a vow annexed to holy Orders, which yet proceedes but from the Churches Ordination: in ſo much as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, not in holy Orders, <hi>Elected,</hi> may lawfully marry, and ſome alſo hold, that a Biſhop <hi>confirmed,</hi> may doe the ſame, but of this I doe not diſpute, yet if he marry it is valid.

            <p n="9">9 With theſe commodities, proper to Religious ſtate, are to be ioined, two other, moſt important conſiderations, of ſecurity, and Immobility, wherin a Religious ſtate, exceedeth that of a Biſhop. Security from euill, and Immobility in good, are great points of happynes, and participations of the Saints felicity in Heauen. And in the buſines of our ſaluation, euery ſmall addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to true, and not preſumptuous Hope, ought to be greatly eſteemed. For as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſay, that a leſſe knowledge of more perfect obiects, for example, of God, or Angels, is to be preferred, before a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge of inferiour things, as of the elements, or mixt bodies: ſo in maters that concerne Eternity, a ſtate more ſecure, &amp; leſſe ſubiect to change, is in that, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, before a ſtate, higher, but not ſo ſecure, or immoueable. It was a worthy ſaying, of a great Preacher, that men in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Epiſcopall ſtate, are apt to haue
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2914:59"/>their eyes vpon certayne conſiderations, which would quickly vaniſh, if they made another reckoning, and duly pondered, for how many ſoules they are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and perhaps they would finde, that euen in a rich Biſhopricke, they pawne their owne ſoule, for ſo great a number of other mens, that for each one, they receaue in payement, not a ſhilling by the yeare, and inferiour paſtours, ſcarce two pence for each ſoule comitted to their chardge.

            <p n="23">23 The firſt is: That perfection co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts in Charity, and that the three Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Counſels are <hi>noe perfection,</hi> but inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>meanes</hi> to atraine perfection: by which manner of ſpeach, ſo indiſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſed, the reacer may be apt to value the Luargelicall Counſels, much vnder their true worth. And therefore to cleare the matter: We muſt obſerue, that the ſayd Counſells may be conſidered either as of themſelues they are apt to remooue impediments of Charity, and loue of God, for example, Pouerty, and Chaſtity euen of their owne nature, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily free a man from the daungers, temptations, and impediments of the loue of God, which ariſe our of the actuall poſſeſſion of riches, &amp; enioying the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

Seing then the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Counſelles, ſealed with a vowe, are acts of great, and noble vertues, it
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2914:75"/>followeth, that they are not only moſt fit inſtruments to attaine perfection, which conſiſts in charity, but alſo are cauſes, and perfections of <hi>perfection</hi> it ſelfe, not only remoouing impediments of Charity, but alſo affording it poſitiue helps, &amp; <hi>increaſe.</hi> All which wilbe more confirmed, by what I am nowe going to ſay, concerning a ſecond point of doctrine, auouched by <hi>M.

            <p n="24">24 In his 11. <hi>Chap. num.</hi> 12. thus he writeth: <hi>There is only this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betwixt Religious, and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the Religious leaue all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, other Chriſtians muſt leaue them in preparation of mind.

Num.</hi> 18. he writeh thus: <hi>ſome may obiect, that ſome Religions Orders are inſtituted to preach, and to conuert Nations. Ergo, to theſe at leaſt it appertaineth as well, as to the secular Cleargy to do theſe functions. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: that theſe Orders are indeed inſtituted to that purpoſe, but yet to help only, and aſſiſt the Cleargy; and to this they were not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the deuine law, as Biſhops, and Prieſts are, but by the Churches Inſtitution.</hi> To this anſwere of <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> I anſwere, that, as I ſad aboue, in England Regulars, are no more ordained to <hi>help</hi> Secular Prieſts, then Secular, to <hi>help</hi> Regulars, but both a like are ſent, endued with Priuiledges to be <hi>helpers</hi> of ſoules; &amp; Superious of Regulars, haue as much authority to ſend their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as Preſidents, or Rectours of Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to ſend Secular Prieſts. And becauſe <hi>M. Doctour,</hi> in the <hi>obiection</hi> ſpeakes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, of <hi>conuerting Nations,</hi> where it is cleare there is no diuiſion of Pariſhes, or Dioceſſes, or inſtitution of Pariſh Prieſts,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2914:101"/>and the like: I vnderſtand not, how he can imagine that in ſuch a worke, Regulars are only to help the Secular Prieſts: yea, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Lord <hi>Philip Rouenius</hi> (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in my 5. <hi>Queſtion</hi>) Regulars are more ſit for that employment then Seculars. What he ſaith, that ſuch Religious, were not by the deuine law ordained to preach, as Biſhops, and Prieſts are, hath been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the ſame 5. <hi>Queſtion,</hi> where I ſhewed, that neither Secular, nor Regular Prieſts, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n preach without authority, and that Religious be as capable of ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Office as Seculars: So as (if he compare a right Secular with Religious) he will in this find no difference. And I may add, that Regular Prieſts, of ſuch orders as <hi>M. Doctour</hi> mentioned in the <hi>obiection,</hi> haue a particular kind of right, or, as I may ſay, <hi>diſpoſitionem proximam,</hi> to ſuch functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſecular Prieſts, preciſely by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſts, haue not. For although Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſts of ſuch Orders, haue no <hi>actuall Iuriſdiction,</hi> or authority for the exerciſe of ſuch Actions, till they receiue it from their Superiours; yet by their Inſtitute, they haue a kind of right, to haue ſuch authority graunted by their Superiours, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2914:101"/>iuſt cauſe, ought not to debarre them of that, to which they haue obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by vndertaking that particular courſe of Religious life. But Secular Prieſts haue no obligation to ſuch functions, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be made Paſtours, and take care of ſoules, which thouſands neuer do, nor haue any obligation, to vndertake ſuch a charge. Of the Apoſtles vow of pouerty, whereof <hi>n.</hi> 19. he taketh a needleſſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to treate by reaſon of an obiection which himſelfe maketh, I haue ſpoken ſomething in my 5. <hi>Queſtion;</hi> &amp; wiſh that ſome, more able, would do it more at large.

Becauſe Biſhops ſucceed the Apoſtles, therefore <hi>not the Regulars, but the Seculars ſucceed the Apoſtles:</hi> as if the name of Biſhop, neceſſarily implied to be a <hi>Secular;</hi> or as if Religious Biſhops, becauſe they are not <hi>Secular,</hi> cannot ſucceed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in the office of preaching &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2914:106"/>ſuch his authority dreadfull to Catholicks. For if this <hi>generall authority</hi> which he giues to my Lord, be onely in <hi>foro interno,</hi> then it taketh from my Lord, power to make a certaine Hierarchy of Vicar Generals, Arch deacons, &amp;c. (for ſuch offices are for authority in <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To ſay, my Lord hath ſuch power, but is reſolued not to practiſe it, will not ſatisfy: becauſe they are loath, all their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity ſhould depend vpon the free will, or particular dictamen of a man, although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſoe learned, and wiſe, who either vpon ſome new occurring motiues, and reaſons, or by the inſtigation of others, may alter his minde, and practiſe that, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe once had no intention to practiſe. And they will thinke, that they are leſſe to be blamed for ſuch a feare, ſeeing my Lord claymed an authority (for example of approouing regulars, for hearing the Confeſſions of ſecular perſons) which prooued not to be due vnto him, &amp; which did concerne, euen the lay Catholicks, in higheſt degree (for who would not rather
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2914:107"/>haue their bodies diſioynted on the racke, then their ſoules tormented with ſcruple of inualid Confeſſions?) they will, I ſay, thinke it no vnreaſonable feare, that if my Lord, in that particular, challenged an authority not due, he might in ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion practiſe a Right granted as due. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if ſuch Authority be not practizable, why ſhould it be pretended? eſpecially with ſo great feare, and offence of many worthy Catholicks. Rather, the very pretending it, will put men in feare, that ſomething elſe is intended, beſide a bare power, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be practiſed. But, as I ſayd, my meaning is not, to meddle with my Lords Authority further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is neceſſary for <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion,</hi> of ſome propoſitions, deliuered by <hi>M.

Biſhop incroach vpon their Priuiledges, and that although there be ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him, and them concerning approbation, yet they neede not feare their other Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:</hi> as if their other Priuiledges, were more priuiledged then this, or had power to hinder men from making whatſoeuer clayme againſt them. Rather, by what
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2914:107"/>hath bene attempted in one, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture what may befall the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Num.</hi> 12. He ſayth there are <hi>no other lawes againſt a Biſhop, then are already enacted, and in force againſt Prieſts, and Religious.</hi> What the lay gentlemen, who are skilfull in the moderne, and antient lawes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, iudge of the particular danger, to which they might be hable, if they ſhould accept my Lord as Ordinary, <hi>M. Doctour</hi> will finde in their ſayd letter. That which more properly belongs to me, is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were in this, the ſame reaſon of a Biſhop, and Prieſts; yet the neceſſity of hauing Prieſts, and a Biſhop is not alike. Without the one we cannot haue remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſinnes, the holy Sacrifice of the Maſſe, the bleſſed Sacrament of the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar &amp;c. Without the other, we may haue all things, euen the Sacrament of <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> for as for ordaining Prieſts in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, it is neither needfull, nor, for any thing I know, practiſed by my Lord of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>

            <p n="15">15 And thus hauing ſet downe, ſome few, of thoſe many things, which might haue bene obſerued, in <hi>M. Doctours Treatiſe,</hi> I will make an end, if firſt I haue ſincerly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2914:108"/>told the reader, what was my wiſh, when I vndertooke this <hi>Diſcuſſion,</hi> and what at this preſent my harty deſire is, &amp; I hope in God for euer ſhall be. My wiſh at the firſt was: That, rather then I ſhould vtter any thing, in diminution of Charity, in diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſacred <hi>Epiſcopall Dignity,</hi> in preiudice of the <hi>common good of Catholicks;</hi> Almighty God would forbid my penne to <hi>caſt inke,</hi> and (if that were not enough) <hi>benumbe</hi> my <hi>right hand,</hi> as it happened to the Emperour <hi>Valens,</hi> while he was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Decree, to baniſh that holy Monk, and Biſhop, <hi>S.

My preſent deſire is, that howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer Regulars may by ſome be eſteemed to oppoſe for their own ends, the hauing a Biſhop in engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or ſome authority by him chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged; yet in teſtimony of the contrary, I, who acknowledg my ſelfe, of all others the moſt imperfect, am not ſo inſenſible of the good of ſoules, but that I would moſt willingly ſpend my bloud, for the purchaſing of times, ſutable with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of a Catholick Biſhop in England, endued with as much Authority, as any particular Biſhop in the whole Church of God. And vpon this happy condition,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2914:108"/>I cordially wiſh, that the laſt moment of writing theſe lines, might prooue, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt tearme of my life.</p>
